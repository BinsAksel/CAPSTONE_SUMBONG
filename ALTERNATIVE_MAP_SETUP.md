# Alternative Free Map Solution - OpenStreetMap with Leaflet

Since Google Maps requires billing setup, here's a completely free alternative using OpenStreetMap and Leaflet.

## Benefits:
- ✅ Completely free
- ✅ No API key required
- ✅ No credit card needed
- ✅ Open source
- ✅ Good map quality

## Setup Steps:

### 1. Install Leaflet
```bash
npm install leaflet react-leaflet
```

### 2. Add CSS to public/index.html
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css" />
```

### 3. Replace Google Maps with Leaflet
The location modal will use OpenStreetMap tiles instead of Google Maps.

## Implementation:
- Interactive map with click to select location
- Current location detection (using browser geolocation)
- Address search using free Nominatim geocoding service
- All the same features as Google Maps version

Would you like me to implement this free alternative instead?
