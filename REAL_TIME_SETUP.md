# Real-Time Complaint Updates Setup

This project now includes real-time updates for complaint status changes. When an admin changes a complaint status (pending, in progress, solved), the user's dashboard will automatically update in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-time Status Updates**: Complaint status changes are reflected immediately on the user dashboard
- **Real-time Feedback Updates**: Admin feedback appears instantly on the user side
- **Visual Indicators**: Status badges with color coding and recently updated row highlighting
- **Live Connection Indicator**: Shows when real-time updates are active
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Handles connection drops gracefully

## How It Works

### Backend (Server-Sent Events)
- Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for lightweight real-time communication
- Each user connects to `/api/realtime/:userId` endpoint
- Server maintains connections and sends updates when complaints are modified
- Automatic reconnection handling

### Frontend
- User dashboard establishes SSE connection on load
- Automatically updates complaint list when status changes
- Shows toast notifications for updates
- Visual highlighting for recently updated complaints

## Testing the Real-Time Updates

### 1. Start Both Servers

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd sumbong/backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd sumbong/frontend
npm start
```

### 2. Test Real-Time Updates

1. **Login as a regular user** and submit a complaint
2. **Open another browser/incognito window** and login as admin
3. **Go to admin dashboard** and find the user's complaint
4. **Change the complaint status** (pending → in progress → solved)
5. **Watch the user dashboard** - it should update automatically!

### 3. Test Feedback Updates

1. **As admin**, add feedback to a complaint
2. **Check user dashboard** - feedback should appear immediately
3. **User gets notification** about new feedback

## API Endpoints

### Real-time Updates
- `GET /api/realtime/:userId` - SSE endpoint for real-time updates

### Complaint Status Updates
- `PATCH /api/complaints/:id/status` - Update complaint status and feedback
- `PATCH /api/complaints/:id` - General complaint updates (also triggers real-time)

## Real-Time Event Types

- `status_update` - When complaint status changes
- `feedback_update` - When admin adds/updates feedback
- `connected` - Initial connection confirmation
- `ping` - Keep-alive messages

## Technical Details

- **SSE Implementation**: Lightweight alternative to WebSockets
- **Connection Management**: Automatic cleanup and reconnection
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback and retry logic
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead, efficient updates

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Check browser console for SSE errors
- Verify backend server is running
- Check CORS settings if needed

### Updates Not Working
- Ensure user is logged in (has valid userId)
- Check browser console for real-time connection status
- Verify complaint belongs to the logged-in user

### Performance Issues
- Real-time updates are lightweight and shouldn't affect performance
- Connection automatically reconnects if dropped
- Updates are batched and efficient

## Browser Support

- **Modern Browsers**: Full support for SSE
- **Mobile**: Works on mobile browsers
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation if SSE not supported

## Security Considerations

- Real-time connections are user-specific
- Only authenticated users can connect
- Updates are scoped to user's own complaints
- No sensitive data exposed through SSE
